# Estimating the bit error rate in a communications system

This project explores the use of confidence intervals when estimating the bit error rate (BER), or probability of bit error, for a simple digital communications system. The goals of this project are:

1. To estimate the BER of a communications channel using simulated received values.
2. To compute different confidence intervals for the BER estimates.
